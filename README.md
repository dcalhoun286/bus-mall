### About This Project

For this assignment, I was given a case in which I was hired by a startup called BusMall, whose catalogues are placed on local busses for potential customers to look at while commuting through traffic. BusMall only wants to feature items in this catalog that are most likely to sell, so I created a market analysis on proposed products to test my client's potential customer interest before these items are placed in the catalog.

#### Objectives/Feature Tasks

- App's purpose: Displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side).
- Results cannot be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made to keep the product selection process as untainted as possible.
